# bops-fm
Download songs from Bandcamp and Soundcloud.

#Description
Bops-fm is a web application for downloading songs from both Bandcamp and Soundcloud with accurate metadata. It's built with Laravel and Vue. All you need is a valid bandcamp or soundcloud song/album url and voilÃ ! 

#How It Works
Bops-fm downloads songs to the storage/tmp folder of your Laravel project and it arranges songs by Date of Download->Album Name.

#Notes
Bops-fm is still under development and it's currently available by cloning this repo, running it [assuming you have Laravel installed] and accessing it at whatever domain you map the project folder to.
